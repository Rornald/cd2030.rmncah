\title{Plot Sub-National Reporting Rates by Year and Unit}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_average_reporting_rate}(
  x,
  plot_type = c("heat_map", "bar"),
  indicator = c("anc_rr", "idelv_rr", "vacc_rr", "opd_rr", "ipd_rr"),
  threshold = 90,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{cd_average_reporting_rate} object, typically the output from
\code{calculate_average_reporting_rate()}. Must contain subnational data.}

\item{plot_type}{Either \code{"heat_map"} or \code{"bar"}:
\itemize{
\item \code{"heat_map"}: Shows reporting rates using color-coded tiles by year and unit.
\item \code{"bar"}: Displays reporting rates as bars, grouped by year and faceted by unit.
}}

\item{indicator}{One of the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"anc_rr"}: Antenatal care
\item \code{"idelv_rr"}: Institutional deliveries
\item \code{"vacc_rr"}: Vaccination
\item \code{"opd_rr"}: Outpatient visits
\item \code{"ipd_rr"}: Inpatient admissions
}}

\item{threshold}{Numeric value (default = 90). Used only in \code{"heat_map"} mode to define
the boundary for high reporting rates.}

\item{...}{Reserved for future use.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Visualizes reporting rates for selected health service indicators at sub-national levels,
using heat maps or bar plots. Intended for use with outputs from
\code{calculate_average_reporting_rate()} at \code{"adminlevel_1"} or \code{"district"} level.
}
\details{
Only subnational objects are accepted. If the data was computed at \code{"adminlevel_1"} with a
\code{region} argument, the object is automatically treated as \code{"district"} level and plotted
by district name.

\strong{Heat Map Mode}:
\itemize{
\item Each tile represents a reporting rate for a unit and year.
\item Colors:
\itemize{
\item Green: \verb{>= threshold}
\item Orange: \verb{70 <= value < threshold}
\item Red: \verb{< 70}
}
\item Labels display the actual percentage.
}

\strong{Bar Mode}:
\itemize{
\item Bars show values per year.
\item Units (regions or districts) appear as facets.
\item Color gradient shows low to high reporting.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Heat map for vaccination at district level
x <- calculate_average_reporting_rate(data, admin_level = "district")
plot(x, plot_type = "heat_map", indicator = "vacc_rr")

# Bar chart by district in selected region
x <- calculate_average_reporting_rate(data, admin_level = "adminlevel_1", region = "Nairobi")
plot(x, plot_type = "bar", indicator = "idelv_rr")
}
