\title{Plot Coverage by Denominator Source with Survey Reference}
\usage{
\method{plot}{cd_indicator_coverage_filtered}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame of class \code{'cd_indicator_coverage_filtered'} as returned by \code{\link[=filter_indicator_coverage]{filter_indicator_coverage()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not used).}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing coverage by denominator type and national survey line.
}
\description{
Generates a bar plot comparing DHIS2-based coverage using various denominator sources
against national survey coverage.
}
\details{
The function visualizes discrepancies in coverage estimates derived from different denominators:
DHIS2 population, ANC1, Penta1, UN projections, and optionally others. The horizontal line indicates
national survey coverage for the selected year, aiding in identifying possible under- or over-estimation.
